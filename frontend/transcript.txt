Lesson 9C & D : Ambassador Grinius & DPRK vs. US 2 playersï»¿
You are watching from 17:00 to 48:17 in total. Ambassador Marius Grinius speaks from 17:00 to 25:47 about the Great Game among China, Russia (small partner) and against the United States From 25:47 to 48:17 he speaks about China and cooperation in the Korean Peninsula.

0:01 hello everyone I'm extremely pleased to welcome Ambassador Marius guerninius to 0:07 our Zoom recording and to our class and we've known each other for about 10 years now I'd say and he has had a very 0:14 illustrious career which I'll go through with you but I'll just let you say hello to the students and I know that they're 0:21 going to learn a lot from our time together hi gang I used to listen to these sort 0:27 of things but but uh presume so and we'll try not to make you fall asleep 0:34 well I'm sure that won't happen I'm going to share a screen that and then introduce Mary's more formally so that 0:41 you know a bit about his background and how he became a diplomat and continues to be one today 0:50 okay so can you see that uh Mary's can't see on the screen 0:55 uh okay so he's a graduate of the royal Military College and we were just talking about stories from the military 1:02 from the last century and maybe you want to tell us a little about how you decided to join the military in the 1:09 Canadian Army and some of your experiences during the Cold War so he served in the United Kingdom and also in 1:16 West Germany which was a key part of NATO's commitment at that time and then 1:22 Ambassador Marius joined the Canadian Foreign Service in 1979. so he became eventually and we'll talk 1:30 about what he did before that but he eventually became the Ambassador which is the highest position 1:36 in the delegation of Canada to Vietnam and then he was the ambassador to the 1:42 Republic of Korea which is the official name for South Korea and then he was the 1:47 Ambassador actually at the same time to the dprk which I've spoken about with you today and or before and we're going 1:54 to talk more about North Korea with Ambassador grinius he 2:00 then served as Ambassador and permanent representative to the UN and conference on disarmament in Geneva and that's 2:07 where I met amarius was when we were at the United Nations at the npt review conference and he kindly granted me an 2:15 interview so that was our first time that we met I think back in 2007. his earlier postings included 2:22 Bangkok and which is in Thailand twice Brussels at the Canadian delegation to 2:28 Nato in Belgium and Hanoi in Vietnam 2:33 I want you to just listen here a little bit because now the department of external Affairs they changed the name 2:40 to Foreign Affairs and now it's Global Affairs so when Marius joined he was a desk officer which sounds strange but it 2:48 means that you're in charge of looking at all the information and and writing 2:53 up reports for ambassadors so he was doing that for nuclear arms control and then he became the director for 2:59 Southeast Asia uh later he had two tours of service in the PCO which is short for 3:05 privy Council Office working on a social policy development and security and 3:11 intelligence so I'm not sure if he can talk about that but he also did a tour in the department of Western which is 3:17 not here at Western but western Canada economic diversification in 2011-12 Mary's was seconded which 3:26 means brought from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of National Defense which we call DND 3:34 and as the Director General International security policy which is a very senior senior position and he 3:40 retired after 45 years of service to Canada so he continues to very actively give 3:47 presentations on Canadian foreign and defense policy on all sorts of things related to Canada's place in Asia 3:54 particularly on Korea and the Korean Peninsula he's a fellow at the Canadian 3:59 Global Affairs Institute and we'll share this recording with them and a member of The Advisory board for r2p the Canadian 4:06 Center for r2p which is short for responsibility to protect a doctrine that Canada promulgated and put forward 4:12 and he's the former vice president of the royal Military College Club of Canada this is a very extensive 4:18 extensive biography but I just want to mention what might be relevant to our 4:23 discussion today he was also the chair of the biologic and toxic weapons 4:28 convention which I haven't talked to you about yet but that's short for the btwc 4:33 which is a convention that prevents the dispersion of biological and toxic 4:39 weapons and then he was the first Secretary which is different from being a secretary but the top official to Nato 4:46 when NATO was expanding at the end of the Cold War and then in the 80s at the 4:52 height of the Cold War he was in charge as a desk offer sort of nuclear arms control and disarmament so I'll stop 4:58 sharing there and this is a such an extensive and Incredibly impressive 5:03 biography of Arizona we're really honored to host you in this class and 5:08 I'm going to start out by by asking you how you decided to enter the Canadian Army and then eventually to join the 5:16 Canadian Foreign Service what was it that motivated you at a young age to to give your life to a service for Canada 5:23 well first of all thank you Eric for Erica for enjoying for inviting me to 5:29 this uh this uh series of talks um and um I I certainly like to uh share 5:39 stuff as an old fogy and and what have you hopefully it's uh more relevant uh 5:47 today perhaps than even it was in the in the past I have to start I think uh with 5:55 saying that my family post uh or during World War II uh ping from Lithuania they 6:03 were victims of World War II fortunately they ended up west of the East-West 6:12 divide and uh also fortunately that the 6:17 Canada accepted them as the what called refugees in those days but that they 6:24 were called displaced persons and so we ended up in Canada and shortly after I 6:31 was was born the motivation so again proud to be a Canadian proud to have a 6:40 Lithuanian Eastern European background but the motivation for 6:48 perhaps from my grandparents in particular was service to Country and 6:56 that sounds pretty you know kind of old-fashioned even modeling but that's 7:01 what uh what drove me I certainly was interested in military Affairs uh thanks 7:10 to one of my grandfathers who was in the tsar's Cavalry Once Upon a Time and 7:17 um and from there it was a question of either going believe it or not it was 7:24 either going into medicine and I was accepted with scholarships or going to 7:30 the Royal Military College and I decided I was just not too serious enough for 7:36 medicine and I was delighted to be accepted at uh at RMC and I have to say that 7:45 later of course I went through the formal uh competitive process actually 7:52 while serving in West Germany West Germany to to join uh the foreign 7:58 Canadian Foreign Service but I have always said that had it not been for the 8:06 Foreign Service I would have been extraordinarily happy to stay in the 8:11 military and serve continue to serve Canada and so it is service to Canada 8:17 that has always motivated me thing I didn't know 8:24 that from Lithuania my mother's side is from Latvia and they also escaped 8:29 because of Hitler and my grandfather was in the czar's Army as well in Moscow so there we have a few commonalities that 8:36 we didn't know about before on my mother's side um and my mother came to Canada and was 8:43 not a refugee as well and met my dad on the boat and he was from New Zealand so here we are um but I bring that up only 8:50 because it's so interesting to hear that you could have gone into medicine and so many of the students here are striving 8:55 to get into medicine and yet you have had you've been extremely successful in the career that you chose in the Foreign 9:01 Service with the military background when you were in West Germany where were 9:07 you deployed it uh that was my last military posting and that was at um what 9:15 was called uh headquarters Canadian Forces Europe in lar in the black forest 9:20 and I was a staff officer for the commander of CFE and uh again it was at 9:29 the height of uh the Cold War it was all about uh where will the Warsaw Pact and 9:38 the Soviet Army how is it going to uh attack uh Western Europe we we did a lot 9:48 of Defense uh policy and planning on how to meet and 9:57 stop uh particularly the Soviet tanks and that of course was in the day is 10:05 when tactical nuclear weapons seem to be uh the the the 10:12 ultimate last minute uh Choice unfortunately 10:17 you saw what uh what transpired and it's 10:23 you have to remember your history and hopefully not make the same mistakes but 10:29 um but everything uh the the Soviet Empire as you know fell and ironically 10:36 by that time I had by late 89 19 10:43 when uh when the Berlin Wall was coming down and everything I was at NATO and I 10:49 have to uh you bring up certain memories but the thing that struck me the most 10:55 perhaps was okay uh we were we had been negotiating the convention of 11:04 um uh conventional forces in Europe uh treaty with the Warsaw Pact uh that's 11:10 that was my close uh my my main focus and it was an interesting time and then 11:17 lo and behold of the Warsaw Pact uh fell apart and so did the Soviet higher but 11:24 at NATO there was a sense of yay we won 11:30 the Cold War you know and people just started to talk about the the piece of 11:36 the dividend and all of that kind of stuff but what set in was a reality check and that 11:44 happened and you will know about that because you spend so much time at uh NATO 11:50 um there was a reality check to say uh oh now what 11:56 and suddenly from my perspective and I think from a lot of people who were at NATO at that time the world just became 12:06 a lot more complicated and much more unpredictable 12:11 and okay we've had NATO expansion I was in Hanoi when 12:19 when the Czech Republic Poland and Hungary joined NATO and we had the 12:25 ambassadors got together and by the way the three new NATO members at that time 12:32 they were hosting the us but their big 12:37 thing was the fact that they were their countries were returning to what what they 12:45 considered as western civilization and never mind all the politics of the 12:52 Soviet Union and the human rights issues but it was Western Civilization right 12:58 it's something that I'll always remember did they talk about Article 5 and that 13:04 they wanted to be defended by Article Five or or were they just not cognizant of them they were you know these were 13:12 ambassadors they they knew their stuff unlike some of us but uh the uh it was 13:21 they didn't talk about that what they were more focused on was this was an 13:28 important step certainly from a security point of view and all but their focus 13:35 was the next step will be joining the EU and as much about it about economic uh 13:45 prosperity peacefulness uh trade all of that kind 13:50 of stuff that was as important to them as the security the hardcore security 13:57 aspects you know that's so interesting how the beliefs evolve from worrying about the 14:04 good thing in court or in the full the Gap and attack by the Soviets to embracing the EU passport and being 14:11 their kids being able to work anywhere in Europe you know that was really important it's interesting how the 14:16 values change over time and now Vladimir Putin is talking about NATO and as if 14:22 Nazism and NATO are the same and that they have to fight uh Nazism and NATO 14:28 and NATO going so close to the near abroad to their territory do you think 14:34 that people I remember being at NATO headquarters in 1999 around when you 14:39 were there um with Nicholas Butler in 2006 and anyway at the time I didn't get the 14:47 impression that they were too worried about NATO expansion it was like sure we'll just keep expanding the Liberals 14:54 were happy they didn't think about Russian insecurity at all or worry about what Russia saw or did you see behind 15:01 the scenes more that they were worrying about threatening Russia's security by expanding too quickly 15:08 well I no there there wasn't any um discussion about that I I think it 15:16 was more the question of hey there's a new leader of the Soviet Union 15:24 uh got a betrov who looked pretty pretty 15:29 impressive and by the way uh gorovachov at one point when he was the minister of 15:36 Agriculture who visited uh Canada and his good friend the Soviet Ambassador 15:44 here yakolev whom I had met as the desk officer he was the guy who kind of told 15:53 gorbachov the the positive aspects of cooperation working uh changing the old 16:02 Soviet system to something that was much more Progressive and yakolev of course 16:07 became one of his main uh advisors back in Moscow and then yelts 16:15 in and then uh so I need to bring that up because I I did have um clearance to see classified 16:22 documents in the department of Foreign Affairs and I copied it typed out one which was that one you're talking about 16:28 because he was in agriculture he was the minister of Agriculture and he came to Ottawa and his commentary was the air is 16:35 so clean and they took notes on that he he was on a building and he and they didn't know who he was they didn't know 16:41 he was going to become president but just the minister of Agriculture was here and you know we were talking about 16:46 this and he seemed very impressed so it's interesting that we keep such detailed notes even at the minor level 16:53 and then later Gorbachev became the president so but I remember that that I 16:59 remember those notes and typing it all out because you weren't allowed to photocopy that was 17:05 that was illegal let's move forward in time to uh Korea and to the Korean Peninsula and to your experiences uh in 17:14 Seoul and I'm not sure if you ever actually got into North Korea did you ever get to Pyongyang or did you get to 17:20 travel into North Korea I'm sure I did and 17:26 um I actually uh what had happened was that our ambassador in Beijing was also 17:37 cross-accredited to to North Korea but the Ambassador was changing in Beijing 17:46 and it was an opportunity for Canada for uh Department of Foreign Affairs to kind 17:53 of re-jig the responsibilities because uh South Korea and Seoul were really 18:03 so uh focused on North Korea it was a bit like Hong Kong uh having its eyes on 18:11 China Once Upon a Time well the um here was an opportunity for Canada along with 18:18 a number of other ambassadors in Seoul who were cross accredited and we called ourselves by 18:26 the way Club Pyongyang because it was not necessarily a lot of 18:31 fun to to be in Pyongyang but I I made four trips in there and the first one 18:38 was by air cordio and we survived that because during my time we've had one air 18:47 choreo thunder in Catch Fire as it landed at the breaks 18:54 anyway I took the train with three of my 19:00 other trips you go to Beijing and then you go 19:05 oh interesting and quite frankly it was more 19:11 interesting because it was a little bit safer not much safer because there were 19:16 problems with the train system in North Korea but it gave me an opportunity in 19:22 my stuff and usually I had a political officer and a a translator an 19:30 interpreter from our Embassy because she could not rely on North Korean interpreters uh so we we traveled there 19:38 and back and it was a bit of an adventure right food and stuff but uh but it was also 19:48 for me an opportunity just to see the countryside the train uh because it was 19:56 so wonky could not travel that night so that was a good thing for those of us 20:03 who could um you know see what was happening and uh so and there were other 20:09 interesting adventures in that praying part but uh but anyway I got in there 20:17 four times met very senior people from uh from the party 20:23 um was probably the Communist party I better tell the student like from the Communist Party okay yeah which they 20:30 call this party yeah great party people yeah um drank a lot the um but uh I also 20:39 got to uh so met various senior people 20:45 in within the Central Committee of the party uh but also uh because of my 20:53 military background and also I I suspect because of my uh security and 20:59 intelligence um time uh they were they were interested to meet me oh I'm sure they 21:06 were you were in the PCO in charge of security intelligence they were very interested in meeting with you well 21:12 I guess this was you wouldn't have had a cell phone but it was the military side and uh what 21:21 what was interesting to me was everywhere in the Ford during the four trips where 21:27 we went inside and outside of Pyongyang I always had two minders keeping an eye 21:34 on me and making sure that you know I didn't jaywalk 21:39 um or anything like that but during the my time with uh the military it was 21:46 supposed to be just a courtesy call about 15-20 minutes an hour and a half later really I got 21:55 out and with my delegation but the minders the political Ministry of 22:01 Foreign Affairs minders were not allowed into that meeting and they ran out of cigarettes it was 22:08 cold it happened to be winter and they were left outside 22:15 um ran out of cigarettes and it was really really too bad for for them and 22:21 we had a Frank and fraternal ex discussion about nuclear weapons and of course they basically took the part well 22:29 it was the party line nuclear weapons are saving us from those running dog 22:37 U.S imperialists and all of that kind of stuff but the thing was that I could talk military to them yeah 22:45 uh challenge every every little bit of 22:51 their uh call it uh Dogma or their beliefs so it was a fund a Frank and 22:58 fraternal exchange of views meaning brotherly but kind of being 23:03 sarcastic I think yeah so that's very interesting you you must you very fortunate to meet North Koreans let 23:10 alone at a high level and to travel through North Korea you're one of the very very few people I've ever met 23:18 and I've been to Korea so on either on delegation and so on and even the Japanese Ambassador had never never set 23:25 forth in in set foot in North Korea so so this is you know kind of you're 23:31 unique in that way and it's very interesting for the students to learn that when we talk 23:37 um in class about the United States imperialist enemy um do you think it's a kind of a 23:43 two-person game between North Korea and the us or do you think there's more Powers involved like you mentioned China 23:50 Beijing Japan do you think that it's a much more complicated multi-polar world 23:56 now and so it's much more difficult to to to cope with crises and to cope with 24:02 difficulties uh you bring up a lot of things and I'll 24:07 try to um comment on on several of them I have 24:13 with respect to the world in general I think uh my my line for almost 10 years 24:21 has been that there is a new great game being played uh between an ambitious 24:30 ascendant uh China with global Ambitions obviously and I 24:36 think it's all has happened uh aided and abetted by what I call a junior partner 24:44 Russia and and uh against the United States the 24:50 great hegemon from uh according to the the Chinese and and of course in the 24:56 United States uh especially during the Trump era uh I think the United States 25:02 is still uh suffering from the Aftershock in the aftermath of that and 25:08 it'll take some uh some time but I think they're back on track but so there is 25:14 the great game and in that context for Russia and China 25:20 um it's in their interest to have something like a North Korea 25:26 to get Americans to focus more on that to keep them keep the United States off 25:33 balance as of course Chinese and Russian uh kind of Interest coincide right now 25:42 and move and move forward the other premise uh that one has to I believe 25:49 think about just is very strongly is that Kim 25:55 Jong-un Kim III I like to call him uh because of 26:00 the Dynasty is uh is not going to negotiate away his nuclear weapons and 26:08 we've seen more and more of the missile tests and everything like that and speculation about a seventh underground 26:15 nuclear test that may happen anytime actually and and of course this is 26:24 connected directly to regime uh survival 26:30 and so you've got that complex other game 26:36 um that is being played out and and of course then you have all the relations 26:43 between Japan uh Annex colonial power that had in the 26:50 early 1900s had occupied uh what is down North and South Korea plus 26:58 Manchuria uh that plays into the history and there there's still a lot of 27:05 unhappiness there was um a naval military exercise this week and uh 27:15 despite the fact that the United States has gotten South Korea and Japan to cooperate more uh the South Koreans said 27:23 we don't like the reference to the Sea of Japan and we like to call it uh the uh the 27:33 East sea so please start talking about that and of course the Japanese said no 27:40 come on this is officially the Sea of Japan Etc so you that's how niggly you 27:47 can get in terms of what never mind Comfort women uh during uh 27:54 World War II never mind the Japanese having said you are not going to speak 28:01 Korean you will change your family name to uh to a Japanese name during their 28:08 occupation and people remember this you know uh Santa Yana you know remember 28:13 your history or you're going to repeat it so it's all of these parts are still 28:20 being played out and it's very similar in many respects in terms of the Ukraine 28:26 and and Russia and the perceptions of their own history both Mutual or 28:34 antagonistic I mean there's so it's all it's all out there it's still being played out and uh we hope that diplomacy 28:44 will come back but are you saying then it is 28:49 complicated but that because nuclear deterrence is clear it's easy to understand if you strike me I will hit 28:56 you back for sure and Destroy You Mutual assured destruction so don't you think that that is such an easy Doctrine to 29:03 understand that in a way that's why it works everyone understands it the 29:08 Japanese the Koreans the North Koreans and that is why Kim Jong-un will retain the Arsenal at least minimal deterrence 29:15 a minimal deterrent works well the yes I'm having served at NATO I 29:24 think and in just in general with my own experience uh despite all of the 29:31 controversy over whether nuclear deterrence works or doesn't work uh the 29:37 threats by Putin to start doing more in terms of maybe 29:44 nuclear weapon tactical nuclear weapons uh that line fortunately has not been 29:54 um broached and you know the people who do not believe in 30:01 deterrence as a as a an ultimate and and you're you're much more expert in that 30:08 area than than I am but uh you know the the guy who's falling out of uh 30:17 so deterrence works but [Music] it really does it's as basic as what do 30:26 you do with a bully in the in the schoolyard do you let him 30:32 do everything or do you stand up to him and punch him in the nose not with a 30:37 nuclear weapon I hope but uh but the the same analogy I I think is a very human 30:44 analogy and hopefully it continues to uh to work 30:49 it is interesting because Kenneth Waltz who was a neorealist and out he 30:55 advocated South Korea obtaining its own nuclear Arsenal back in 1999 and in a 31:01 sense Japan might be more secure if it had it if it had a clear clear deterrent 31:07 it's close it could develop its own nuclear weapons quickly but Waltz argued 31:12 that the whole area would be more secure if everyone had their own small nuclear stockpile it's it's a logical argument 31:20 but it's just the fact that one would be threatening nuclear war against in in a 31:28 small Peninsula I don't know which way the winds would blow you know that the nuclear tests in in um 31:35 uh North Korea there came out a few days ago saying that the water aquifers may 31:41 be damaged by radiation and that we uh the people who are escaping from North Korea are being tested 31:48 for um radiation levels and 80 of them have far too high radiation levels of 31:55 the 440 that they checked so it's frightening to think that the North Koreans had possibly damaged the 32:02 aquifers in that small Peninsula by their endless testing 32:07 Kim Jong-un does not care about his people you know he's he's nice and fat 32:13 and his Norman clatura our uh well pampered because he has to keep them on 32:20 the side it's funny you you mentioned Kenneth Waltz because I have one of his books and if you look at it it's all 32:28 underlined because as nuclear arms control officer that was part of my 32:35 personal reading along with all the great thinkers from uh of on those sort 32:43 of on that particular subject so still 32:48 still relevant in terms of it's fascinating to that you were able 32:55 to live a real life where you saw these Concepts being played out with real 33:01 human beings and so on so um but it is it is hard to imagine that Kim Jong-un 33:07 would give up the nuclear weapons uh at all and but I do you think that if he 33:13 was for example as fascinated or eliminated that the next person his 33:18 sister might think about abolishing nuclear weapons or at least moving away 33:24 from such an aggressive it's still about regime change one of 33:31 one of the things that I truly believe uh these days as Gonna Keep 33:38 reading watching talking with the people the 33:43 um there's so much media coverage Western media coverage on oh 33:51 what is the United States going to do what is you know what's the relationship 33:56 with North Korea and it's gone through a lot of changes strategic uh strategic 34:03 patience to fire and fury to Love Letters to now 34:11 they uh they actually uh call it sort of a calibrated practical approach but the 34:19 thing is people because perhaps a western media focus in particular 34:26 forget I believe that it's China that is the decision maker I I can I 34:35 still think that that North Korea is a vasel state of China 34:42 Kim Jong-un has visited Xi Jinping four times Xi Jinping reluctantly came once 34:50 to uh Pyongyang but the question right now is 34:56 will China accept North Korea as an official nuclear 35:04 weapon state like Pakistan like India uh possibly Israel and that I think is 35:14 still the line that the Chinese because they're smart they're strategic they're 35:22 they are truly students of history and 35:29 um so I do not think that ultimately China will accept 35:35 North Korea as a nuclear weapon state and of course Kim Jong-un smart guy he's 35:43 uh he's he's got it down pretty reasonably in terms of where he can push 35:52 and where he would be in trouble if he did 35:58 something really outrageous like uh attack South Korea or Japan with a with 36:07 a nuclear uh strike for instance there's an interesting there's a super 36:13 interesting dynamic between China and North Korea going back to the Korean 36:19 War I would say tongue's only son died in the uh Korean War and the North 36:27 Koreans when you go to their defense of the Fatherland front Museum 36:33 that shows how Kim il-sung the great leader 36:39 defeated the American imperialists and United Nations and Canada and all of 36:46 that kind of stuff um when I when I asked them so 36:51 how did China help out ah they they were on the periphery they 36:57 didn't do too much you know despite the fact that what how many hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers were 37:05 killed uh defending North Korea so there's there's again the history and 37:12 the interpretation of History uh and that Dynamic uh plays out between China 37:18 and North Korea even now interesting the legacies of World War II 37:24 and how they play out also for NATO decision makers because a NATO didn't 37:29 get involved in the 1950s 53 War the north the Korean War 37:35 um but they did the NATO allies themselves contributed a great deal of resources so it wasn't a NATO War but 37:42 they do see that as an American land important War so the Americans 37:48 interpret it very differently as well it's interesting all the different interpretations 37:54 um from Walt's the leader of China and then to Kim 38:00 Jong-un his grandfather and what they learned from each other too all men 38:07 I can't help but say that every single one of them um which is interesting so uh what what 38:13 I think we're going to come to a close here but I'm wondering if there's any lessons for negotiation that you wanted 38:20 to impart to the students is it better to to show that you can hit hard 38:27 the golden rule is do unto others what are some kind of basic lessons for 38:33 negotiation that that you learned that were very useful well the 38:39 first of all you have to talk to the other side and that's where I'm 38:47 rather disappointed that Canadian foreign policy with respect to and North 38:55 Korea uh under Harper I described it to the Foreign Affairs 39:02 Committee of parliament as South Korea democratic 39:09 therefore good North Korea communists therefore bad that was how sophisticated 39:17 Harper policy but there has been a 39:23 tendency just to let things slide that way I and I hope that 39:31 eventually we'll we'll get it right um from a Canadian 39:37 interests point of view um I believe that 39:43 at first of all Canada has to be realistic in terms of what it can do as 39:49 opposed to the big players but just like in the arms control world going back to 39:58 care Trudeau strategy of Suffocation verification of Arms Control treaties we 40:05 and other like-minded countries can contribute and sometimes as I said to my 40:13 American British and French friends at NATO uh 40:19 during all of that turmoil time I said you guys you three guys do not have any 40:26 Monopoly on wisdom you guys all make mistakes and sometimes maybe Canada and 40:33 others can help you out so in terms of how negotiations can be done I think 40:40 that's pretty important the other element on that in terms of diplomatic 40:46 relations I have advocated that we have to return to talking directly to the 40:54 North Koreans and being there uh I cannot believe 41:00 we certainly get a lot of information from our friends and allies in terms of intelligence and one have you but as a 41:10 Canadian as an ex-diplomat but just as a Canadian 41:16 um I don't think that we should rely on being told what is happening in North 41:24 Korea we have to see for ourselves and that was part of the reason that I loved 41:30 going back and forth because you could see um how badly the land 41:37 has uh was eroded that you know the next 41:42 level of starvation is just around the corner and all of that uh kind of stuff 41:49 the other element in any negotiation with particularly a dictatorship I I actually 41:58 do not like the the element of ah this is an authoritarian government no so 42:05 they're dictators call it like it is uh there there's a 42:11 lot of that kind of let's Tamp down the vocabulary vocabulary is very important 42:16 but it has to be uh right out there but one of the things is 42:22 um getting people North Koreans as an example getting them 42:28 as much information as they can as you can about the outside world I think that 42:35 the fall of the Soviet Empire the reunification of East and West Germany 42:42 in part happened because East Germans could get West German TV 42:49 uh that uh other members of the west of the Warsaw Pact uh the Eastern Europeans 42:57 uh could know what was happening uh 43:02 the control in North Korea is a lot tougher but 43:09 it's also starting to crumble the challenge that uh that the West has with 43:17 respect to Putin's dictatorship now is along the same lines in terms of what 43:24 ordinary Russians know they most of them apparently still believe that it's 43:32 Ukraine's fault uh the Ukraine is only little Russia all of that kind of stuff 43:38 it's all NATO's fault it's U.S and all of that kind of stuff but once 43:44 information seeps in you know it's that crack in the the wall 43:51 the light that gets in of like Leonard Cohen once said 43:57 um that uh that is uh that is really really important long term but at the 44:03 same time you have to talk and keep things fairly steady and that's a real 44:10 challenge sorry for the for the long side tribe but uh there are good lessons 44:15 those are very good lessons to communicate and to try to conquer stereotypes and reach out and I do worry 44:22 about how one would be able to reach out to North Koreans because if they even have a videotape of Desperate Housewives 44:29 or whatever it is they can be killed or sent to a prison a prison camp for for life and and so it's it's very hard with 44:37 the radio there's no radio signals that go into North Korea there's no computers it's it's a black hole 44:44 um but like you said it's got to collapse at some point and I'm full that it will collapse and and it'll be a soft 44:51 Landing for China with not an inflow of refugees because as you know the Chinese 44:56 are concerned about emaciated refugees coming over the border and affecting their domestic policy so that's another 45:04 reason China's got to keep an eye on it I I I've challenged our Chinese friends 45:10 every time I go to I used to go to Beijing I challenged them on that China 45:15 a great power if Thailand where I did Refugee work with boat people in the in 45:22 the early 80s can handle a flood a tsunami of Chinese of refugees 45:29 the uh China with all its capacity can handle any size it's an excuse that 45:36 China is is using and I've told them that I don't know if they believed me 45:41 but that's what I've told them I think the concern just on that was the 45:47 Chinese are saying that the North Koreans might be because of the long-term famine uh 45:52 smaller and and less intelligent and and it will be a society that not like the East Germans which are easier to 46:00 integrate this will be a society that has a completely different belief system and will be very difficult to manage 46:06 is that what you're hearing from China or in America China can do they can handle everything 46:15 uh I of course have spent time on the 46:20 north side of the demilitarized zone I've seen their soldiers some of them 46:26 not much bigger than their AK-47s uh but uh but yes these were the people 46:34 who uh grew up as kids during the 90s 46:39 that um uh that the famine really hit and 46:45 it's really possible to more of that uh can uh it can occur the so again 46:54 that's another reason why Canada has to be there because we have to have a good 46:59 idea of what Canada can bring to the world food program the World 47:06 Health Organization UNICEF all of this kind of stuff if the 47:12 next uh uh crisis and it will happen uh 47:18 happens from a humanitarian point of view so we have to have the information 47:24 and we have to be there to see which we used to do but no longer 47:31 well I'm hopeful that this next generation of students nurses Aviation Engineers that they will spend some time 47:38 outside of Canada and maybe they will help the who or UNICEF or go on cue so 47:44 we don't know what they'll be doing but I'm sure that they'll remember this talk from you and in particular a lifetime of 47:51 service for Canada and in many different environments many challenging environments and and you've you've done 47:57 super well for yourself so congratulations and and thank you very much for for our plot on behalf of the 48:04 students thank you very much for for coming to our class my my pleasure uh thank you very much 48:12 for the invitation and it's fun to talk so thank you
